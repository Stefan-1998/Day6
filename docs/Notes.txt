Notes


The distance is always maxed somewhere between the start and the end. 

formal for distance:
x(t) = v(t) *  t

formal adapted to this usecase

v(t) = 0 for t <= t_charge
v(t) = t for t > t_charge

=> start the function after t_charge
and only looking at the end distance

x_end= t_charge * t_running           | t_charge = t_all -t_running
x_end= (t_all - t_running)*t_running
x_end = t_all * t_running - t_running²
t_running²-t_all * t_running +x_end = 0


t_running_1 = t_all-sqrt((-t_all)²-4*1*x_end)/2
t_running_2 = t_all+sqrt((-t_all)²-4*1*x_end)/2

t_all of the race and the x_end distance of the record holder are given.
With this it is possible to calculate both possibilities, when the record holder released the button

This function (t_running²-t_all * t_running +x_end = 0) is quadratic and therefore a curve with no directional change and a maximum
So all times between t_running_1 and t_running_2 will produce an higher max distance
